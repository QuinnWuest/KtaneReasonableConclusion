  Title: The Reasonable Conclusion Casing
  Description: 'Why download a bunch of different mods to get different sized bombs
    when you can download one mod and get ALL of the sized bombs? Introducing the
    reasonable conclusion, with cases sizes ranging from a small 2x2 to a game-busting
    22x22. Any number of modules (of the form n^2 * 2 -1) is now yours to puruse.


    (Usage of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801400247]mod
    selector mod[/url] is recommended, as the game will often select a case that is
    too large.)'
